Below is where the Tastedive API kicks in. Here is where you will search for an artist that you like and related artists will be produced.

Once you have entered an artist, the related artist's results will appear in a spotify playlist where you can save it and listen to at a later point. This is where the Tastedive API feeds into the Spotify API.
